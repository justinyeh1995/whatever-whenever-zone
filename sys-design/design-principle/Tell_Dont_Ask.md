## E&R

Define Eintities

if something maintains state or enforce rules -> a new Eintity
if it is just info attached to something else, just let it be a field.

Define Relationships

## Class Design

Define State & Behaviour (methods)

## Implementation

invalid inputs, illegal operations, out-of-range values, calls that violate the current system state—anything that must be rejected or handled gracefully.

## Verification
